Anstasi map port for STUBB HULT. This was my first ever port

Guide on how to setup extender for maps

1)Where to download?

https://github.com/official-antistasi-community/A3AExtender

2)Setting up

Upack and run Intall.ps1 (you may get asked to change your powershell permissions in order for this to work) you will then be asked to input a name. Name it what ever you want this is just gonna be folder where all your mods go so it isn't just for a single addition.
DO NOT RUN BUILD.ps1 just yet, nothing bad will really happen but there's also no point in doing so.


3)Setting up the folder shiz


Go into your lovely named folder and head to maps, in here your gonna have to a make a copy of an already exsisting map folder, so just do that but name it the map your trying to port and make sure to copy the style of current ones. Important to keep the Antistasi at the beginning and also have a shorter name after the fullstop.


4)Editing the files yipeee

Files going to be editing 
config.cpp
mapinfoglobal.hpp (later on)
navgrid.hpp
Stringtable.xml
